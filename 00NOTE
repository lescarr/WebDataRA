This now supports Twitter and Quora in primary/secondary mode.

1) Collection of FEATURES and use in summary tables (Authors, Mentions, Hashtags, Edges) is bespoke and ad-hoc. Must be generalised. 
1a) everything platform needs an ID to key the individual records
1b) ID must be sortable into a reasonable order. It should be a type, not a name
1c) The use of FEATURES across primary/secondary modes must be generalised
1d) The relationship between platforms in primary/secondary modes must be generalised
1e) Empty Hashtag/Edges tables clutter up Quora
1f) Color of Users/Profiles is bespoke

2) SPECIAL is bespoke and needs to be GENERALISED

3) Duplicate messages need to be debugged. Two HELOs sometimes appear. WTF?
A post-CLEAR message is always lost - that's fine.

4) If "Scroll Downwards" gets to the end, (in the Chromeblahblah version) then
nothing happens.

5) Clear button doesn't cause the display to refresh. Message snafu.

6) Need some indication that the state has changed to "FINISHED"
